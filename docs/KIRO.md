# Kiro adapter

How `agentic-coding-harness` drives `kiro-cli`, what it can *prove* about the configuration a run used,
and what it can and cannot tell you about usage. Everything below was measured against
**kiro-cli 2.21.2** (engine v2, API-key auth) on 2026-09-12; fixtures under `tests/fixtures/kiro/`
are sanitized captures from that binary, and the automated tests run only against those fixtures
and a fake ACP server (`tests/fixtures/kiro/fake-acp-server.ts`). No test spends credits unless
`KIRO_CALIBRATION=1` (see [Paid calibration](#paid-calibration-opt-in)).

## Two transports

| | `headless` (default) | `acp` |
|---|---|---|
| Command | `kiro-cli chat --no-interactive --output-format stream-json --agent-engine v2 [--model M] [--agent A] [--effort E] [--trust-tools …]` | `kiro-cli acp [--agent A] [--model M] [--effort E] [--trust-tools …] [--agent-engine …]` |
| Wire | stream-json envelopes on stdout | newline-delimited JSON-RPC on stdio |
| Model request | `--model` is forwarded; on 2.21.2 it is **accepted and ignored** (`[warn] failed to set model 'X': Method not found`, session store records `auto`) → `modelAck: unsupported`. A CLI that stays silent leaves it `unverified` | `initialize → session/new → session/set_model`; the ack (or its error) is recorded → `modelAck: acknowledged` / `rejected` |
| Agent / effort / tools forwarding | forwarded as flags (`--agent`, `--effort`, `--trust-tools=…`); **not verified** — the chat transport never echoes them | forwarded as flags; mode verified from `session/new.modes` |
| Native session id | sniffed from the first envelope carrying `data.sessionId` (`runStarted`) | `session/new` result; on `--resume <id>`, the resumed `<id>` |
| Resume (`--resume <id>`) | `--resume-id <id>` | `initialize → session/load <id>` (no `session/new`), then the prompt goes to `<id>`. A load that fails is a terminal `session/load` error; it never falls back to a new session |
| What `result.kiro` reports | `{ cliVersion, transport: 'headless', requested, effective: { argv, trustFlag, … }, nativeSessionId, modelAck, configHash }` | `{ cliVersion, transport: 'acp', requested, effective, nativeSessionId, modelAck, configHash }` |

Pick the ACP lane when you need the run to *prove* which agent and model it used. The headless
lane forwards the same configuration and records exactly what it passed (the argv, minus the
prompt, is part of `effective` and of `configHash`), but on 2.21.2 it can only prove a model
request was *refused*, never that one was honored. The MITM credit tap auto-starts on the headless
lane only.

### MITM tap scope

kiro-cli passes its environment to every shell command the agent runs, so the tap's
`HTTPS_PROXY`, `SSL_CERT_FILE` and `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` reach those commands too. The tap
therefore intercepts only the hosts it meters (`codewhisperer.*.amazonaws.com` and
`runtime.*.kiro.dev`, passed to mitmdump as `--allow-hosts`). Every other host is tunneled
unchanged through the proxy, so a `curl`, `npm` or another vendor's CLI in the agent's shell
talks to the real origin and sees its real certificate. `SSL_CERT_FILE` points at a bundle of
the system roots plus the tap CA, so OpenSSL clients still verify tunneled hosts. If Kiro moves
metering to a new host, add it with `ACH_KIRO_TAP_HOSTS` (comma-separated host regexes, no
port), for example `ACH_KIRO_TAP_HOSTS='q\.[^:/]*\.amazonaws\.com'`.

### Verified configuration (`modelAck`)

`modelAck` is one of:

- `acknowledged` — `session/set_model` replied `{}` and `session/new` (or the ack) named the model.
- `rejected` — the agent answered the request with an error; the run fails before prompting when
  `kiro.requireModelAck` is set.
- `unsupported` — the CLI printed the *Method not found* warning (headless lane) or does not
  expose `set_model`.
- `unverified` — a model was requested on the headless lane and the CLI said nothing either way.
  The flag was passed; whether it took effect is unknown (check the session store's model).
- `not-requested` — no `--model` was given; `effective.model` is whatever `session/new` reported
  (`auto` on a fresh session).

An `unsupported` ack also surfaces in `result.warnings` (once per run), as does a requested model
that disagrees with the model the session store recorded.

`configHash` is a stable hash of the sanitized `effective` object so two runs can be compared for
"same configuration" without diffing artifacts. Credentials are never copied into `effective`.

## Running

CLI:

```sh
harness run --agent kiro --kiro-transport acp --kiro-agent dotai \
  --model claude-haiku-4.5 --json "list the files in this directory"

harness run --agent kiro --kiro-transport acp --kiro-agent dotai \
  --kiro-effort high --kiro-tools read,fs_read --kiro-require-mcp-startup "…"
```

| Flag | `kiro` config key | Values |
|---|---|---|
| `--kiro-transport` | `transport` | `headless` (default), `acp` |
| `--kiro-agent` | `agent` | native agent name (a *mode* over ACP) |
| `--kiro-engine` | `engine` | `v1`, `v2`, `v3` |
| `--kiro-effort` | `effort` | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max` |
| `--kiro-tools` | `tools` | `all`, `none`, or a comma list |
| `--kiro-require-mcp-startup` | `requireMcpStartup` | boolean; fail the run if MCP startup reports an error |
| `--kiro-startup-ms` | `startupMs` | positive integer ms; startup/handshake budget (default 60 000) |
| `--kiro-require-model-ack` | `requireModelAck` | boolean; ACP: fail before prompting if `set_model` is not acknowledged |
| `--kiro-mcp-server` | `mcpServers` (append) | ACP only: repeatable, one JSON object per server — `{name, command, args?, env?}` |

`tools` unset means **no trust flag is passed at all** on either lane; the native agent config
decides. There is no implicit `--trust-all-tools` anywhere (0.3.x passed it unconditionally on
the headless lane). Every `KiroConfig` key now has a CLI flag; for example:

```sh
harness run --agent kiro --kiro-transport acp --kiro-agent dotai \
  --kiro-mcp-server '{"name":"fs","command":"npx","args":["-y","@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem","."]}' \
  "…"
```

MCP (`harness_run` / `harness_run_async`):

```json
{ "agent": "kiro", "model": "claude-haiku-4.5", "prompt": "…",
  "kiro": { "transport": "acp", "agent": "dotai", "requireModelAck": true } }
```

Library: `RunSpec.kiro` takes the same object, validated by `KiroConfigSchema`
(`src/core/types.ts`).

### Preflight — prove the setup without spending a prompt

```sh
harness preflight --agent kiro --kiro-transport acp --kiro-agent dotai --model claude-haiku-4.5 --json
```

or the MCP tool `harness_kiro_preflight`. It runs a real ACP handshake and reports, per check,
`verified` / `failed` / `unproven`: binary + version, auth, native agent exists (mode listed by
`session/new`), model exists + `set_model` ack, MCP / governance state. It sends **no**
`session/prompt`. Exit code is 0 only when nothing failed. The
`_kiro.dev/mcp/governance_disabled` notification appears on healthy sessions and is not treated
as an MCP failure.

### ACP traps (recorded so you do not rediscover them)

- `initialize` returns **nothing** unless the request carries `clientInfo` and
  `clientCapabilities.terminal`. A silent initialize is a client bug, not a hung agent.
- Initialize took 15–23 s locally (profile lookup retries), so the startup deadline defaults to
  60 s (`kiro.startupMs`), and a timeout names the failing phase (`spawn`, `initialize`, `session/new`,
  `session/load`, `session/set_model`, `session/set_config_option`, `mcp`, `session/prompt`).
- `session/load` without `cwd` makes kiro-cli (2.21.2 and 2.28.0) **exit 0 with no response and no
  stderr** (#117). The harness always sends `cwd` (the run's cwd, else the process cwd). An unknown
  session id answers `-32603 Internal error` with the reason in `data`
  (`Failed to start session: Session not found: <id>`), which the error message carries.
- While `session/load` is in flight kiro replays the session's history as `session/update`
  notifications. They are history, not this run's output, so the harness drops them (counted as
  `replayedUpdates` on the handshake receipt).
- Never pass `-v`; it logs to stdout and corrupts the JSON-RPC stream.
- Engine v3 (`--kiro-engine v3`, measured on kiro-cli 2.29.0, #127) is supported over ACP, but
  the CLI flags do not apply there: `kiro-cli acp --agent-engine v3` exits 2 if it also gets
  `--agent`, `--model`, `--effort` or a trust flag. The harness passes only `--agent-engine v3`
  and then, after `session/new` or `session/load`, calls `session/set_config_option` for `mode`
  (the agent; workspace and user agents from `.kiro/agents` are listed as modes), `model` and
  `effortLevel`. v3 does not implement `session/set_model`, and it accepts unknown values
  silently, so each value is checked against the options v3 returns. An agent that is not
  offered fails before the prompt, and the error suggests `--kiro-transport headless`. An effort
  the model does not offer also fails (Haiku models have no `effortLevel`). A fresh workspace can
  send its model list after `session/new`; the handshake waits up to 15 s for it. `kiro.tools`
  becomes the answer to `session/request_permission` (`all` allows once, a list allows matching
  tool ids or ACP kinds, `none` or unset denies). In our 2.29.0 runs v3 did not send permission
  requests at all and ran shell tools on its own, so on v3 `tools` cannot narrow what kiro's own
  settings already allow. The run evidence says so: `effective.toolTrust` is
  `acp-permission-policy`.
- `session/prompt` resolves with `{stopReason}`; the harness surfaces it as the native stop reason.
- Agent→client requests (permissions, fs, terminal) are answered by policy — permissions are
  denied — and recorded as events; the harness never broadens them.

## Usage: what is real on 2.21.2

| Signal | Available? | Where it comes from |
|---|---|---|
| credits | **yes** | stream `metadata.meteringUsage[].value` (cumulative) > session store `metering_usage` > MITM tap `meteringEvent.credits`; reconciled to one charge, disagreements become a warning |
| context tokens | **derived** | `contextUsagePercentage × context_window_tokens` (200 000 on 2.21.2); shown as `ctx ≈ N tok`, never billed |
| input / output / cache tokens | **no** | no surface reports tokens (kiro-cli 2.28: none on the wire, v2 store zeros, v3 store `sess_<id>/messages.jsonl` has no token fields, ACP none); on 2.21.x every token field is `0`; the harness reports `tokens.available = false` and renders `n/a` |
| USD | **no** | nothing maps credits to dollars; `--budget-usd` on a kiro run warns that the cap is unenforceable |

The rule is: a `0` that cannot be distinguished from "not reported" is never shown as `0`.
Details and the fixture-backed source table are in
[TOKEN-COUNTING.md](TOKEN-COUNTING.md#kiro-on-221x--no-source-carries-a-token-count).

`result.usage` carries `{ tokens, credits, usd, context }`, each with `available`, `source`,
`scope`, `cumulative`, `complete` (`UsageAvailability` in `src/core/types.ts`). The run registry,
`harness dash`, and the HTML report read the same object.

## Limitations in this release

- **The headless lane forwards configuration but cannot verify it.** `--agent`, `--effort` and
  `--trust-tools` are passed and recorded in `result.kiro.effective.argv`, and `modelAck` is
  `unsupported` on 2.21.2 or `unverified` when the CLI is silent; only the ACP lane returns
  `acknowledged`. Use `--kiro-transport acp` (or `harness preflight`) when the claim matters.
- When the MITM tap and the stream both observe a charge, the run reports both (`sources.stream`,
  `sources.tap`) and keeps the native figure as the total; a disagreement between them raises a
  warning instead of being silently summed.
- The `kiro-cli --version` probe is capped at 3 s (`KIRO_VERSION_PROBE_MS`); a binary that hangs
  on `--version` reports `cliVersion: 'unknown'` and the run proceeds.
- `--trust-tools` on 2.21.2 did **not** block a `read` and no `session/request_permission`
  arrived, so a tool restriction is recorded per tool from evidence, never asserted from the flag.
- Fixtures are 2.21.2. The 2.21.4 sample in issue #2 uses the same envelope family; the
  compatibility check is the version number in `result.kiro.cliVersion` (`2.21.2` on both
  transports; `'unknown'` when the probe or handshake failed).

### stderr notices

Two classes of headless stderr line are classified rather than treated as opaque progress
text: the model-ack warning (see `modelAck` above) and an MCP dynamic-client-registration
failure. Both surface as a `step` event (`payload.kind: 'modelAck'` or `'stderrNotice'`) and
the raw line is still forwarded as an ordinary `progress` event too — classification never
suppresses it. A `stderrNotice` step also carries a `warning` string, which the driver folds
into `result.warnings` (deduplicated).

The MCP registration failure looks like this on kiro-cli 2.21.2:

```
Dynamic registration failed: Registration failed: HTTP 400 Bad Request: malformed payload: invalid message version tag ""; expected "2.0"
```

The line never names the offending server. In practice this fires when Kiro's global
`~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json` (or an agent's own `mcpServers` list) registers a server that Kiro
tries OAuth dynamic client registration against and the server rejects — for example a
ToolHive/vMCP aggregator that does not implement DCR. Remedy: remove or scope that entry out of
`~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json` for harness-driven runs, or pass `--kiro-mcp-server` to supply a
per-run `mcpServers` set instead of relying on the global config.

This classifier runs on the **headless** transport only (`src/adapters/kiro.ts` `onStderrLine`).
The ACP transport (`src/adapters/kiro-acp.ts`) keeps stderr only as a bounded ring buffer for
error diagnostics (`stderrTail()`); it has no per-line hook that turns stderr into events, so
there is nothing to wire the classifier into today.

## Paid calibration (opt-in)

`tests/kiro-calibration.test.ts` is the one test that spends credits. Every other test under
`tests/` is fixture-only, and this one is skipped unless `KIRO_CALIBRATION=1` — a plain `npm test`
reports it as `skipped 4` rather than silently omitting it.

```sh
KIRO_CALIBRATION=1 KIRO_CALIBRATION_AGENT=<native agent> \
  node --import tsx --test --test-timeout=240000 tests/kiro-calibration.test.ts
```

Use that form, not `npm test -- tests/kiro-calibration.test.ts`: the `test` script's glob is
`tests/*.test.ts src/adapters/*.test.ts`, so a path after `--` is *appended* and the whole suite
runs, not just this file. `KIRO_CALIBRATION_AGENT` is optional — when set it is forwarded
as `--kiro-agent`.

**What it spends.** Two prompts (`Reply with exactly the word pong.`) to `claude-haiku-4.5`, one per
transport, ~50 s wall. Measured 2026-09-12 against kiro-cli 2.21.2: **0.0556 credits** headless +
**0.0166 credits** ACP = **0.0722 credits** for the file.

**What it proves.** It drives the real `harness run --json` entry point (`spawnSync` on
`src/cli/ach.ts`, fresh `AGENTIC_CODING_HARNESS_STATE_DIR`) once per transport and asserts, per run:

- `exitStatus: "success"` and `warnings: []`.
- `usage.credits.value` equals `sources.stream` equals `sources['session-store']` within `1e-9`,
  and equals `sources.tap` when the MITM tap observed the run (headless only — the ACP lane does
  not auto-tap, so `sources.tap` is absent there).
- **The calibration itself**: that same figure re-summed straight off kiro-cli's OWN record at
  `${KIRO_SESSIONS_DIR:-~/.kiro/sessions/cli}/<kiro.nativeSessionId>.json`, over
  `session_state.conversation_metadata.user_turn_metadatas[].metering_usage[].value` — the sum
  `tests/driver.test.ts` performs on the fixture, performed here on a store the CLI just wrote.
  A missing store file fails the test naming the path; it never passes.
- Nothing is fabricated: `usage.tokens.available: false` must come with all-zero `inputTokens`,
  `outputTokens`, `cacheReadTokens`, `cacheWriteTokens` on every record and `totalCost: 0` (if a
  future CLI does report counts, the other branch asserts the totals are positive instead).
- `usage.context.available: true` with a positive derived `tokens`.
- Provenance: `cliVersion` carries a real version (not `'unknown'`), `nativeSessionId` is a uuid,
  `transport` matches, `modelAck` is `unsupported|unverified|acknowledged` headless and
  `acknowledged` on ACP, and headless `kiro.effective.argv` forwards `--model claude-haiku-4.5`
  with `trustFlag: null`.
- The model actually answered: an `events[]` `{type:'message', source:'agent'}` whose `content`
  contains `pong`.

A failing assertion prints the transport, the observed figure and the `cliVersion`, so a newer
kiro-cli that changes the credit plumbing or the ACP model handshake is diagnosable from the
failure line alone.
